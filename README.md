Peshitta in Text-Fabric
--------------------------------------

This repo is a research environment for the study of the Peshitta.
You can run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.
To that end, the plain text of the Peshitta has brought into the Text-Fabric format,
which lends itself for easy data processing.

Corpus
------

This repo contains the transcription of the Peshitta in ETCBC/WIT format.
From there it has been converted to a Unicode plain text and a Text-Fabric
data set.

See also [about](docs/about.md).

turn the analysis of ancient data into computing narratives.

The ecosystem is Python and Jupyter notebooks.
