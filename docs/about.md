Peshitta
==============================

This repo is a research environment for the study of the Peshitta.
You can run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.
To that end, the plain text of the Peshitta has brought into the Text-Fabric format,
which lends itself for easy data processing.

Corpus
------

The Peshitta is the Syriac Old Testament.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta).


Text-Fabric features
--------------------
We have a [specification](transcription.md) of the transcription format and
how we model the text in Text-Fabric.


Provenance
----------

The source data in this repo are transcription files in the ETCBC/WIT format.

They have been obtained by the printed edition:

**The Old Testament in Syriac - according to the Peshitta version** by
*The Peshitta Institute Leiden*, published by E.J. Brill, 1987.

The pages have been OCR-ed by means of [syrocr](https://github.com/ETCBC/syrocr),
written by Hannes Vlaardingerbroek.

The printed edition contains a critical apparatus.
That is copyrighted by Brill and not included here.

The plain text result of the *syrocr* program has been converted to Text-Fabric by Dirk Roorda.
